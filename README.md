# CSC450 Senior Research

This is my repository where I will contain all my files that are associated to my Senior Research Class. 

Most files in this repo will be associated to my senior research topic: Which database is better for housing data? NoSQL or SQL (MongoDB vs MySQL)


Abstract

Since 2017, Zillow has consistently had more than 6 billion user per year visit their mobile apps and websites. Zillowâ€™s primary target audience uses the platform to buy, sell, or rent property. Home buyers research homes on the platform, home sellers sell or evaluate their homes, Renters look for rental property, Real estate agents hope to connect with potential clients, and Investors stay up to date on the latest trends in the housing market. With all these different types of users, Zillow must make sure their application and website is giving credible and fast results to their users. To provide their users the best experience, picking the right database is key. 

In this research, I will gather Zillow data, create 2 types of databases (SQL & NoSQL), and compare their performances from CRUD & ACID tests. This will determine what type of database housing data should use.

The Image below is a table of my current work plan for this research project.
